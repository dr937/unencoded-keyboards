# unencoded-keyboards
MTLD Final Project, created a virtual keyboard site which allows for the user to write characters from their own language, 
string them together to make sentences and then save the image and potentially send it to other user in order to communicate
virtually with their own scripts. Created with Megan St. Hillaire, Eve Washington and Gabriela Arredondo as part of our Multilingual
Diversity in Tech course
